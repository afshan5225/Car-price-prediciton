# Car Price Prediction Using Decision Tree

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to predict the price of cars based on various features such as the car’s name, year of manufacture, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and owner type. By building a Decision Tree Regressor model, we aim to provide accurate price predictions to assist in evaluating car prices.

## Libraries Used

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning tasks, including model training and evaluation.

## Execution Methodology

1. **Import Libraries**: Load the necessary Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.
2. **Load Dataset**: Read the dataset containing car features and prices.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Perform data cleaning and feature engineering, including encoding categorical variables and creating new features.
4. **Feature Selection**: Identify and select relevant features for model training.
5. **Train-Test Split**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
6. **Model Training**: Train a Decision Tree Regressor model on the training data.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model’s performance using appropriate metrics, such as R^2 score.
